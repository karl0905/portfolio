The project is a {{booking system}} for restaurants, where the user can book a table at a restaurant and the restaurant can manage their bookings. <br> <br> The authentication, is the most noteworthy part of the project, taking advantage of next.js middleware and built from scratch using a combination of {{JWT}} and {{session tokens}}.",
        "The project consists of two frontends, one for the user, built in {{Next.js}} and one for the restaurant, built in {{React}}. The backend is built in {{Remix}} and uses a {{MySQL}} database to store the data.",
        "The development was managed with {{GitHub Projects}}, taking advantage of {{feature branches}} and {{pull requests}} to ensure a smooth development process.",
        "The frontends are deployed on {{Vercel}} and the backend is deployed on a {{PHP server}}."
